# R&D Strategy Behind Brompton's First Electric Folding Bike

## Vision and Design Goals
- Create a product that is as light as possible without sacrificing durability.
- Maintain extreme compactness, true to Brompton’s unique design.
- Make a practical solution using modern technology after 12 years of development challenges.

## Unique Development Challenges
- Brompton’s unique dimensions required custom development rather than using off-the-shelf equipment.
- Entire systems including gears, motors, and software needed bespoke design due to Brompton’s distinctive form factor.
- Needed internal organizational changes to manage the company’s largest project to date.

## Collaboration and Expertise
- Partnered with Williams Advanced Engineering to leverage expertise in electrical machine design and mechanical design.
- Synergy between Williams' Formula 1 experience and Brompton’s high-performance, lightweight electric machine requirements.
- Worked with specialists in gear design, motor manufacturing, and software development.

## Technical Achievements
- Successfully integrated a Formula E powertrain including the battery, e-motor, control system, and inverter into the compact Brompton frame.
- Motor width was minimized to only 74mm to fit within the bike's form.
- The electric assistance provides smooth torque and significant power while maintaining compactness.

## Battery Innovation
- Battery considered the ‘lifeline’ of the electric bike.
- Designed a system where the battery is separable from the bike weight, allowing the user to carry the battery in a shoulder bag.
- This separation enhances portability, making the bike genuinely easy to carry.
- The battery connection is quick and seamless, enabling the bike to be ready to ride instantly.

## User Experience and Philosophy
- The electric bike had to perform robustly in real-world urban environments.
- Designed to serve both expert cyclists and novices, enabling a wide range of users to benefit.
- Maintains the fundamental Brompton philosophy of freedom and portability.
- Described as feeling like “having a tailwind behind you,” a “secret weapon” for daily commuting.
- The project is viewed as an evolution of Brompton’s traditional principles through technology.

## Overall Impact
- The R&D process represents Brompton’s largest product development undertaken.
- The electric Brompton achieved a balance of maintaining Brompton’s signature qualities while adding high-tech electric assistance.
- The collaboration and innovation mark a significant milestone in Brompton’s product evolution.
